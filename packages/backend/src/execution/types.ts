 * # Execution Plan
 * 
 * The execution plan tree describes the steps that need to be taken to execute a query,
 * as well as which strategies are taken to execute each query.
 * 
 * A parent â†’ child relationship between nodes means that parent needs to be executed before child.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * ```
 *        DB
 *      /    \
 *     DB     http
 *     |       |  \
 *    http     DB  http  
 * ```
 * 
 * In this example, the root node is executed using the DB executor. Once the root node is executed, the two children nodes can be executed in parallel.
 *
